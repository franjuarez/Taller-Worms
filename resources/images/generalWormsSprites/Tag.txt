Comments: I demand that you do NOT give me credit for these. All I did was extract them with Fudge Boy's "The Fiddler" and modified the palettes so that you can use them with Paint without the black in the sprites being ruined. I felt it would be more efficient that way, both animation-wise and time-wise (since it would take me forever to sheet them.) Use as you like, and give credit to Team17 for all their hard work in making these.
